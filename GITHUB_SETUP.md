# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Your repository is ready! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `vidyo-password-manager`
4. Description: `GUI application for managing Vidyo user passwords with month-based usernames`
5. Choose Public or Private (your preference)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/alumbrados/Downloads/qudo/vidyo-password-manager

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vidyo-password-manager.git

# Rename branch to main (optional, modern convention)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all files uploaded:
   - README.md with project documentation
   - Both C# and Python implementations
   - Architecture and implementation guides
   - License and project structure
