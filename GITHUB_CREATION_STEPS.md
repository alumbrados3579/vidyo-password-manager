# GitHub Repository Creation Steps

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need to create the repository on GitHub first!

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `vidyo-password-manager`
   - **Description**: `GUI application for managing Vidyo user passwords with month-based usernames`
